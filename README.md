To deliver a community-friendly solution, our team has developed an online marketing platform which offers users to: buy and sell their second-hand furniture; review or share their good and bad experiences on furniture products they purchase; assist in making well-informed decisions on furniture choices and provide insights on the supply and demand of certain furniture products for manufacturers and interior designers.
